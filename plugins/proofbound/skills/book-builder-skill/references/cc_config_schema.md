# cc-config.yml Schema Reference

The `cc-config.yml` file defines the book's metadata and configuration variables used throughout the Quarto project. This file is processed with Jinja2 templating to generate personalized book content.

## Required Fields

These fields MUST be present for the project to build correctly:

| Field    | Type   | Description                   | Example                                   |
| -------- | ------ | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `title`  | string | Book title                    | `"The Ultimate Guide to Chengdu Cuisine"` |
| `author` | string | Author name                   | `"Richard Sprague"`                       |
| `date`   | string | Publication date (YYYY-MM-DD) | `"2026-02-10"`                            |
| `year`   | string | Publication year              | `"2026"`                                  |

## Optional Metadata Fields

| Field         | Type    | Default  | Description                                     |
| ------------- | ------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `subtitle`    | string  | _(none)_ | Book subtitle                                   |
| `description` | string  | _(none)_ | Book concept/description used for AI generation |
| `page_count`  | integer | `0`      | Updated after PDF build                         |

## Writing & Structure Fields

Two **orthogonal** axes steer how the book reads. Both are settled during intake
(Phases 1–2) and consulted while writing.

| Field           | Type   | Default                | Forwarded to compose? | Description                                                                                               |
| --------------- | ------ | ---------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `writing_style` | string | `practical`            | Yes                   | The _tone_ axis (e.g. `"informative and engaging"`).                                                      |
| `book_type`     | string | `nonfiction_practical` | No                    | The _structural_ axis — how the book is shaped. Selects the structural style guide; forwarded to compose. |

`book_type` is one of `nonfiction_practical`, `nonfiction_narrative`,
`nonfiction_reference`, `memoir`, `fiction`, or `childrens`. It is recorded in
`cc-config.yml` so a resumed session keeps the same structural guide
(`book-type-style-guides.md`, fetched into the prompt cache), and `publish_book.py`
forwards it to `/books/compose` when set (the server validates the key and records
it on the book; unset books get the server default). It shapes the prose you write,
not the typeset output.

## Publishing Information Fields

These fields appear on the copyright page and in book metadata:

| Field                | Type   | Default                       | Description         |
| -------------------- | ------ | ----------------------------- | ------------------- |
| `publisher`          | string | `"Proofbound"`                | Publisher name      |
| `publisher_location` | string | `"Mercer Island, Washington"` | Publisher location  |
| `edition`            | string | `"First Edition"`             | Edition identifier  |
| `printing`           | string | `"First printing"`            | Printing identifier |
| `isbn`               | string | `"[To be assigned]"`          | ISBN number         |
| `cover_designer`     | string | `"Proofbound Press"`          | Cover design credit |

## Website Settings

| Field         | Type   | Description                                 |
| ------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| `page_footer` | string | Copyright notice for web/PDF footer         |
| `site_url`    | string | URL for web publishing (GitHub Pages, etc.) |

## AI-Populated Fields

These fields are populated during the book generation workflow:

| Field                   | Type               | Description                                              |
| ----------------------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `source_materials`      | string (multiline) | Summarized content from uploaded source files            |
| `enhanced_introduction` | string (multiline) | AI-generated book preface/introduction (Quarto Markdown) |
| `enhanced_summary`      | string (multiline) | AI-generated book summary/conclusion (Quarto Markdown)   |

## Jinja2 Template Variables

When creating a new project, the following Jinja2 variables are available:

- `{{ project_name }}` - Project directory name (converted to Title Case)
- `{{ current_date }}` - Current date in YYYY-MM-DD format
- `{{ current_date[:4] }}` - Current year (first 4 chars of date)

### Jinja2 Filters Used

- `| title` - Convert to Title Case
- `| replace('-', ' ')` - Replace hyphens with spaces
- `| replace('_', ' ')` - Replace underscores with spaces

## Usage in Project

1. **During scaffolding**: The `cc-config.yml` is processed with basic variables (`project_name`, `current_date`)
2. **During template rendering**: All fields become available as Jinja2 variables in `.qmd` files
3. **In prompts**: Fields like `title`, `author`, `description` are passed to AI generation prompts
4. **In output**: Values populate the title page, copyright page, and footer

## Validation Rules

For the thin-client publish flow, only `title` and `author` are required —
`publish_book.py` reads them from `cc-config.yml` (falling back to
`outline.yml`'s `book.title`) and forwards `subtitle`, `description`,
`writing_style`, `book_type`, and `trim_size` when present. `source_materials`
is recorded locally to steer your writing but is **not** forwarded —
`/books/compose` rejects unknown fields. The platform performs the authoritative
validation when scaffolding (`POST /books/compose`); fields like
`date`/`year`/publisher are injected canonically server-side and need not be set
locally.
